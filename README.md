# classify-images-VGG-Inception-Xception using downloaded pre-trained models
  <test some images and compared the netwrok performance>
 
 * Step 1: define a map for memorizing the size of images used for network training
 
 * step 2: define an auxiliary function to load & convert each image
 
 * define an auxiliary function for classifying image and prediction and display rank-5 predictions
